***Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture***

 ## Measure and Set Goals
1.  Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

## answer
    

 **Pretexting**

Pretexting involves the creation of a fake identity or scenario to fool a person into disclosing information.

For example, a fraudster may email or call your company claiming to be a supplier, survey firm, municipal inspector or insurance company to get sensitive data. A pretext attacker could also pose as a computer technician responding to a call for service to access

**Online pop-ups**

Malware can infect computers through a “pop-up” that appears while you’re browsing the Internet. A pop-up is a window that opens when you visit a website.

Most pop-ups are legitimate, but in some cases clicking on them can initiate a download of ransomware or a virus.
your network.

**wifi and remote work**

A poorly secured wifi system can leave your business vulnerable to a hacker within range of your network. A hacker could gain sensitive information, damage your systems or install ransomware.

2.  Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting attack**

Fraudsters may ask for little bits of information that don’t raise red flags, but over time, bit by bit, they’re trying to build a profile that could let them steal your identity. but the employee should not respond to such scams or give any information out, no matter how little info is. 

**Online pop-ups**

A pop-up claiming to be from your Internet service provider says your computer has a virus and invites you to call a service number to deal with the problem. You may then be asked to provide identifying information or your credit card number. so the employee should first talk to their supervisor in order to confirm the claiming is real. and shouldn't give any names or account details.   

**Wifi and remote work**

In a public area, you can be at risk if you go online through a “spoofed” Internet server—one set up to appear to be a legitimate WIFI connection. Accessing the Internet via such a machine gives an attacker access to your system and possibly your business network. in that case the employee should not have any access to the company server when they are outside of the company. or they could use secure VPN which will encrypted the data.

3.  What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting**

we should train the employees to do some phishing email, or tax ting see if the employee give any information out. the after that warning your employees about pretexting will also prevent that to happing 

**Online pop-ups**

Malware can infect computers through a “pop-up” that appears while you’re browsing the Internet. Warning your employees may prevent that, for example, may claim your computer is infected with a virus. It will tell you that you need to download software to clean your system. That software will in fact be malware or a virus. so before the employee download that, they should fist talk to supervisor or manager and then use secure VPN and take some safety precautions.

**Wifi and remote work**

employee should be alert when working outside the office. should always use secure VPN network so that they should not give Information that can be compromised if you’re working on a train or plane or in a café, allowing a stranger to read what’s on your screen.

4.  What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting/ Online pop-ups/Wifi and remote work**

 after Training my employees to watch out the emails or calls, my target should be less then 5% or less. because if i only have 5% risk, should be better then 90% risk. 
Train my employees not to click any online pop-ups and to watch out for them, so in the future we can prevent them so that they cant initiate a download of ransomware or a virus.
 Train and set policies for the  employees to use VPN to only log in to the company computers while they are working outside. Also be alert when working outside the office. Information can be compromised if you’re working in area with no secure internet allowing a stranger to read what’s on your traffic, if is not encrypted. 

## Step 2: Involve the Right People
1. Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.
## answer
HR department: they set up training for the employees, from the start when they get hired. and to give the policies and procedures
IT partners department: they set up the policies and procedures for employees to fallow and to insure and maintain secure practices.
managers department: they enforce employees and measure performance and the goals are met.  
employee: all the employees should report any suspicious activities. 
venders department: its the third party that we deal with should enforce polices to be safe and use VPN.  
## Step 3: Training Plan
1. How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)
## answer
every three months all the employees should take rick training, for example, online training that shows what risks are and what could happen.
after they take the online training, test them and prepare small test and see if the employees understand the policies and the procedures.   

2.  What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
## answer
topics that including the training should be what risks are and what they can do to the company. for example if the company server gets ransomware and the all the system of the company is down, how can the company operates from day to day operation. another topic that will included hands-on practice at recognizing and avoiding a wide range of security risks. employee should Recognize Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks. it’s vital that employee should take  the time now to look at where the company or organization is vulnerability will be.  

3. After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?

## answer
official certification exams are some ways to measure training effectiveness. The more data you collect on measurable outcomes, the easier it will be to quantify your company's
after the training, the company should make model measure to see the effectiveness of the training. for example, it might perform a risk analysis to see specifically who is fallowing the training, then determent Employee engagement of the training. Ask staff to rate their own job satisfaction. take Team performance. The gold standard to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of the training is the comparison of empirical observations with a control group in an experimental design or with a counterfactual scenario. for example, the company should training quizzes, one-to-one discussions, employee surveys, etc.
