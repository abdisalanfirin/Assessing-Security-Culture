***Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture***

 ## Measure and Set Goals
1.  Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

## answer
    

 **Pretexting**

Pretexting involves the creation of a fake identity or scenario to fool a person into disclosing information.

For example, a fraudster may email or call your company claiming to be a supplier, survey firm, municipal inspector or insurance company to get sensitive data. A pretext attacker could also pose as a computer technician responding to a call for service to access

**Online pop-ups**

Malware can infect computers through a “pop-up” that appears while you’re browsing the Internet. A pop-up is a window that opens when you visit a website.

Most pop-ups are legitimate, but in some cases clicking on them can initiate a download of ransomware or a virus.
your network.

**wifi and remote work**

A poorly secured wifi system can leave your business vulnerable to a hacker within range of your network. A hacker could gain sensitive information, damage your systems or install ransomware.

2.  Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting attack**

Fraudsters may ask for little bits of information that don’t raise red flags, but over time, bit by bit, they’re trying to build a profile that could let them steal your identity. but the employee should not respond to such scams or give any information out, no matter how little info is. 

**Online pop-ups**

A pop-up claiming to be from your Internet service provider says your computer has a virus and invites you to call a service number to deal with the problem. You may then be asked to provide identifying information or your credit card number. so the employee should first talk to their supervisor in order to confirm the claiming is real. and shouldn't give any names or account details.   

**Wifi and remote work**

In a public area, you can be at risk if you go online through a “spoofed” Internet server—one set up to appear to be a legitimate WIFI connection. Accessing the Internet via such a machine gives an attacker access to your system and possibly your business network. in that case the employee should not have any access to the company server when they are outside of the company. or they could use secure VPN which will encrypted the data.

3.  What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting**

we should train the employees to do some phishing email, or tax ting see if the employee give any information out. the after that warning your employees about pretexting will also prevent that to happing 

**Online pop-ups**

Malware can infect computers through a “pop-up” that appears while you’re browsing the Internet. Warning your employees may prevent that, for example, may claim your computer is infected with a virus. It will tell you that you need to download software to clean your system. That software will in fact be malware or a virus. so before the employee download that, they should fist talk to supervisor or manager and then use secure VPN and take some safety precautions.

**Wifi and remote work**

employee should be alert when working outside the office. should always use secure VPN network so that they should not give Information that can be compromised if you’re working on a train or plane or in a café, allowing a stranger to read what’s on your screen.

4.  What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?

## answer
    

**Pretexting/ Online pop-ups/Wifi and remote work**

 after Training my employees to watch out the emails or calls, my target should be less then 5% or less. because if i only have 5% risk, should be better then 90% risk. 
Train my employees not to click any online pop-ups and to watch out for them, so in the future we can prevent them so that they cant initiate a download of ransomware or a virus.
 Train and set policies for the  employees to use VPN to only log in to the company computers while they are working outside. Also be alert when working outside the office. Information can be compromised if you’re working in area with no secure internet allowing a stranger to read what’s on your traffic, if is not encrypted. 

## Step 2: Involve the Right People
1. Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.
## answer
HR department: they set up training for the employees, from the start when they get hired. and to give the policies and procedures
IT partners department: they set up the policies and procedures for employees to fallow and to insure and maintain secure practices.
managers department: they enforce employees and measure performance and the goals are met.  
employee: all the employees should report any suspicious activities. 
venders department: its the third party that we deal with should enforce polices to be safe and use VPN.  
## Step 3: Training Plan
1. How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)
## answer
every three months all the employees should take rick training, for example, online training that shows what risks are and what could happen.
after they take the online training, test them and prepare small test and see if the employees understand the policies and the procedures.   

2.  What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
## answer
topics that including the training should be what risks are and what they can do to the company. for example if the company server gets ransomware and the all the system of the company is down, how can the company operates from day to day operation. another topic that will included hands-on practice at recognizing and avoiding a wide range of security risks. employee should Recognize Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks. it’s vital that employee should take  the time now to look at where the company or organization is vulnerability will be.  

3. After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?

## answer
official certification exams are some ways to measure training effectiveness. The more data you collect on measurable outcomes, the easier it will be to quantify your company's
after the training, the company should make model measure to see the effectiveness of the training. for example, it might perform a risk analysis to see specifically who is fallowing the training, then determent Employee engagement of the training. Ask staff to rate their own job satisfaction. take Team performance. The gold standard to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of the training is the comparison of empirical observations with a control group in an experimental design or with a counterfactual scenario. for example, the company should training quizzes, one-to-one discussions, employee surveys, etc.  
## Bonus: Other Solutions
*Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern*
*Indicate at least two other potential solutions*
## answer
**Use rating scales** and **Track digital trails**
1. What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?
## answer rating scales
many companies  need a plan to make sure their own people are not the cause of a data breach for both malicious insiders and negligent insiders. However, more training alone isn’t the answer. For subjective measurements, Administrative can create data classification model then a manager can rate their employee on a scale of 1 to 10. The rating should be done at regular intervals and be consistent in both what it measures, and the scale used, to track changes in staff performance. Use the job description to set criteria necessary for the role.
## answer track digital trails
insider attacks puts you in precarious security position. No one can guarantee that every person in your organization who has access to sensitive information will follow the rules  no matter how much training they receive. this control is to also helps us to understand just that. its a technical control that allows managers to track their employees’ work. to explain better way, imaging your digital footprint that can tell you what you doing. every time we go  online, we leaves a digital footprint or trail.  Depending on how they manage it, this  trail. it can be big or small, and harmful or helpful. 

2. What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
## answer rating scale
this controls preventive, it can have reach our goal without any risk. it means that Preventive controls  attempt to prevent an incident from occurring. There is concrete evidence that a large percentage of breaches are caused by employees accidentally or maliciously mishandling sensitive corporate information against policy. for the rating scale model, will tell you what your employees doing and if they need more training to understand the policies and procedures that need to be fallowed 
## answer  track digital trails
this tracking digital trail will help us to get control of what would happen. for example, Your digital footprint is the record of all your interactions online.  so Understanding your digital footprint helps you choose a safe way to prevent ransomware or hacking attack in the future. To start, identify where all your data currently exists within the various data repositories and tools used to store it. You also need to ensure only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information.

3. What is one advantage of each solution?
## answer rating scale
rating scale is easy to understand and quite user friendly. its extremely effective in gathering actionable, useful information from a employees rating survey scale. so that in the company will know where their weakness are and how to prevented. 
## answer track digital trail
Once you’ve reviewed your digital trail, you will have advantage of understanding how your employees doing and what you need to do to improve it. and it will also give you another advantage of preventing any harmful attack inside or outside source. 

4. What is one disadvantage of each solution?
## answer rating scale
even though a rating scale is relatively easy to complete, it may be missing potential data. It doesn't necessarily show how vital a particular feature is, nor does it compare and contrast features to each other in a way that provides any meaningful analysis.
## answer track digital trail
the disadvantage of this, is that The facts is  clearly no one can simply relying on data digital trail to secure your security policies to safeguard the organization from insider or outside attacks that  puts you in precarious security position. No one can guarantee what will happen in the future or at the present. It’s easy to look at the negative aspects of a digital footprint, but This is difficult to measure what the outcome will be.
